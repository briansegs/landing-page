# Landing Page Project

## Inroduction

This multi-section page dynamically lets you add content to the page as a developer. Using JavaScript and the virtual DOM, the navigation menu is built programmatically as sections are added to the HTML document. There is also a feature where when a user clicks on a navigation item, they scroll to the appropriate section rather than getting the default jump.
